Djortunes
---------

Django application to store fortunes (snippets of quotes, eg. IRC/IM ones). Originally inspired by the « [Fortunes](http://fortunes.inertie.org/) » application, by [Maurice Svay](http://svay.com/).

I'm discovering and learning both [Python](http://python.org/) and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) while coding it, so don't expect too much reliability, but I would warmly welcome any code review against the code :)
